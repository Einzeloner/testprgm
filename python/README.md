# Python 
A repository for python programs.

## It's organised and  divided in 3 sections.

## Topics - Has python program topic wise

## Test - Has random programs. No need to pay attention to it, you will not find something useful there.

## pithon.py - It's filled with gibberish which may or may not be used later. Incomplete and not worth anything.

Most of the useful material will be in the Topics folder.
