# A really simple example of if elese loops


# using a user defined fucntion to explain if else
def somefunc():
    x = input("Would you like to create a list or a tuple?[l/t] ")
    # now the if condition for if the statement has the response l
    if  x == "l":
        print("So you want to print a list")
