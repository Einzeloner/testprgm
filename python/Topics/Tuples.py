# The difference between a list and a tuple is that a tuple can't be changed.
# also that the tuple is defined with () instead of []

t1 = (1, 2, 4,)
print("A defined Tuple is " + str(t1))


#printing an element from tuple
print("Printing the second element of the tuple: " + str(t1[1]))
# put shit in the sq brackets and the index that you put is the value that is 
# going to be printed.
