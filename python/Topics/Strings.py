# Starting of the string topic

#Storing string inside a variable 
x = "This is how you store a string for a variable." 

#printing that stored string
print(x)

#Printing string with the print command 
print("Quotations are needed.")

#printing a variable with some predefined string 
print(x + " \nAnd this is an added text")

#printing everything in lower case
print(x.lower()) #Prints the first T in lower case.


#Printing entirely in upper case
print(x.upper()) #prints everything in upper case

#checking whether the string is upper or lower case
# This will return a true or a false value.

print(x.isupper())
#It will say false because the string is not entirely in upper case.

#lets print check if a new variable is completely upper cased
y = "THIS IS ENTIRELY IN UPPER CASE!"
print(y)
print(y.isupper())  
#This will print the variable and check whether this is upper case or not


#same can be done with lower case characters
